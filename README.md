## quickassets

QuickAssets is a simple script in development with the goal of making it easier to generate cache-bustable URLs in PHP.

The goal is to create a simple framework for defining a server (or multiple servers) and automatically setting cache-friendly URLs. You should be handling the actual caching yourself, either with server-side Apache/Nginx settings or with a cache engine like Varnish (or both).

### NOTE

Going forward, **query strings will be the default `showMethod` for QuickAssets**. This will increase cross-server compatibility and ease-of-use. If you would like to use the previous default, set the `showMethod` to `qa_inline`, which will generate filenames in the form `name.CACHEBUSTINGSTRING.ext`.

### ANOTHER NOTE

If you used QuickAssets prior to its Composer integration, you'll need to update your code next time you update, so QuickAssets can be included properly. We _highly_ recommend installing QuickAssets with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) (see ["Using QuickAssets"](#using-quickassets) below) but if for some reason you can't, simply change your code:

Here's the legacy way of including QuickAssets:

```php
<?php
require_once('ABSPATH/to/quickassets/lib.php');
```

Now, do this:

```php
<?php
require_once('ABSPATH/to/quickassets/src/VanPattenMedia/QuickAssets/QuickAsset.php');
```

Again, **we highly recommend installing QuickAssets via Composer**. The above directions are only if you can't, for whatever bad reason.

### Using QuickAssets

Getting started with QuickAssets is easy. First, add QuickAssets to your composer.json file:

```json
{
	"require": {
		"vanpattenmedia/quickassets": "dev-master"
	}
}
```

Then, install QuickAssets with `composer install`.

In your project's code, require QuickAssets and instantiate it:

```php
use VanPattenMedia\QuickAssets;

$a = new VanPattenMedia\QuickAssets\QuickAsset;
```

Next, set up an asset type:

```php
$a->addAssetType('css', array(
	'assetPath' => 'assets/stylesheets',
	'rootPath'  => __DIR__ . '../../public/assets/stylesheets',
));
```

Bind your asset type to a new host:

```php
$a->addHost('/', array(
	'assetTypes' => 'css',
));
```

Echo the result in your template file:

```php
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo $a->url('css', 'style.css'); ?>">
```

And you'll get:

```php
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/stylesheets/style.css?20130626010446">
```
